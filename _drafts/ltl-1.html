<h1>Letter 1: On Time</h1>

<h2>Original Text</h2>
<p> Greetings from Seneca to his friend Lucilius.</p>

<p>1. Continue to act thus, my dear Lucilius – set yourself free for your own
    sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you,
    or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands. Make yourself
    believe the truth of my words, – that certain moments are torn from us, that
    some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach. The most
    disgraceful kind of loss, however, is that due to carelessness. Furthermore,
    if you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest
    portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we
    are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the
    purpose. 2. What man can you show me who places any value on his time, who
    reckons the worth of each day, who understands that he is dying daily? For
    we are mistaken when we look forward to death; the major portion of death
    has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death's hands.</p>

<p>Therefore, Lucilius, do as you write me that you are doing: hold every hour
    in your grasp. Lay hold of to-day's task, and you will not need to depend so
    much upon to-morrow's. While we are postponing, life speeds by. 3. Nothing,
    Lucilius, is ours, except time. We were entrusted by nature with the
    ownership of this single thing, so fleeting and slippery that anyone who
    will can oust us from possession. What fools these mortals be! They allow
    the cheapest and most useless things, which can easily be replaced, to be
    charged in the reckoning, after they have acquired them; but they never
    regard themselves as in debt when they have received some of that precious
    commodity, – time! And yet time is the one loan which even a grateful
    recipient cannot repay.</p>

<p>4. You may desire to know how I, who preach to you so freely, am practising.
    I confess frankly: my expense account balances, as you would expect from one
    who is free-handed but careful. I cannot boast that I waste nothing, but I
    can at least tell you what I am wasting, and the cause and manner of the
    loss; I can give you the reasons why I am a poor man. My situation, however,
    is the same as that of many who are reduced to slender means through no
    fault of their own: every one forgives them, but no one comes to their
    rescue.</p>

<p>5. What is the state of things, then? It is this: I do not regard a man as
    poor, if the little which remains is enough for him. I advise you, however,
    to keep what is really yours; and you cannot begin too early. For, as our
    ancestors believed, it is too late to spare when you reach the dregs of the
    cask. Of that which remains at the bottom, the amount is slight, and the
    quality is vile.  Farewell.</p>

<h2>Response</h2>

<p>Time management. I'm pretty bad at time management. It's interesting
    re-reading this letter after having read ahead a few. This one reads much
    less personal than his later letters. Perhaps an indication of a developing
    relationship.</p>

<p>Much of the letter emphasizes the importance of being present, and aware. One
    of the most impactful parts of this letter epitomizes this: "Whatever years
    be behind us are in death's hands." The acceptance of death as a necessary
    and constant part of life is a Stoic theme, but this sentence reminds us of
    this reality without remorse. Replace 'years' with 'time', and the letter's
    theme is laid bare: time is an expense account you can only hope to balance,
    and never credit. Seneca himself makes this comparison, noting that he only
    balances his by being aware of his expenditures. To him, it seems being
    aware of the waste is enough to balance the waste itself, which I find
    interesting.</p>

<p>Seneca's account of how we spend our time strikes me as a tad cynical:
    "...the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly
    share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that
    which is not to the purpose." Essentially, we spend most of our life not
    doing what we intend to do, either because we fail to act, or we "[do] ill".
    If I interpret "doing ill" to mean not pursuing Stoic virtue, I can
    extrapolate "the purpose" to mean living a virtuous life. I think the
    statement seeks more specific examples than the entirety of life's pursuit,
    though, and in those cases "doing ill" could mean doing that which does not
    benefit the specific pursuit. This could be playing video games instead of
    cleaning my house, for example. In this case, it seems apt to define "doing
    ill" as procrastination, and "the purpose" being whatever our goal is at
    that particular moment. Though an interesting third option is more of a
    relativity approach: we feel that life passes us by fastest while "doing
    ill" or doing nothing, and in general life seems to pass by faster when we
    are not focusing on our task than when we are. The ol' "Time flies while
    you're having fun" chestnut. Not to say "doing ill" is having fun, though.
    Rather, "doing ill" is like partying until 4am, and wondering how it got so
    late.</p>

<p> Live in the moment, be aware of how you spend your time, and always act to
    spend it wisely. Just be aware: no matter how carefully you budget, your
    account will always be indebted to death.</p>
