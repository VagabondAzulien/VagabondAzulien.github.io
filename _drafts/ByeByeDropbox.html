     <h1>Dropbox or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Use Web Apps</h1>
     <p>Like a good nerd, the day I heard about Dropbox I installed it. I made
     use of it's free storage, it's painless sync'ing. Funny pictures, apps,
     books, music: it all went in, it all got sync'd. This was extremely
     helpful when I started working. Install Dropbox on work machine, wait
     for it to sync, and there are all my NES/SNES games waiting
     for some quality procrastination to sink in. Or that picture I really
     wanted to use as my background. Or that music I wanted to listen to. All
     sync'd, all in one place. Organized, efficient, localized; Dropbox'd.</p>

     <p>Then a change of mind: why do I keep all this stuff that I find online
     on my local machine? I'm basically just duplicating files which already
     exist in locations online, offline for ease of access. There are websites
     which already tackle this problem. Thus, my quest began, to migrate from
     Dropbox to existing services, and remove another program from my machine.
     </p>

     <h2>From One to Many</h2> <p>There are many places that the previously all
     centralized content of my Dropbox is heading. 
     <ul>
          <li>Pictures are heading to imgur, for ease of storage and ease of 
          access to both download and share.</li>
          <li>Music is heading to Google Play, or Amazon. Either one will work,
          but not quite decided yet. </li>
          <li>Books to Amazon Kindle or Google Books depending on format.</li>
          <li>Most documents will go to Google Drive.</li>
          <li>Most applications won't go anywhere, either be replaced or
          removed.</li>
     </ul></p>

     <h2>Rationale</h2> <p>There are two primary, and one secondary, reasons for
     this sudden decision. First, I like having control of my environment.
     That's tough in life, but easy on a computer. It's part of the reason I
     love Linux so much. Second, I like my privacy. Again, tough in life, but a
     bit easier on a computer. Dropbox has the ability to delve into any of my
     files as they deem fit. Google is better, but still not completely
     under my jurisdiction. However, they're better enough for the
     inconsequential information I'm storing on their systems. Lastly, and
     secondary, is the fact that Dropbox has moved to a proprietary software
     base. It's a relatively minor gripe, but if I can use and promote open
     software over closed software, I'll do so.</p>
