     <h1>Dropbox or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Use Web Apps</h1>
     <p>Like a good nerd, the day I heard about Dropbox I installed it. I made
     use of it's free storage, it's painless sync'ing. Funny pictures, apps,
     books, music: it all went in, it all got sync'd. This was extremely
     helpful when I started working. Install Dropbox on work machine, wait
     for it to sync, and there are all my NES/SNES games and emulators waiting
     for some quality procrastination to sink in. Or that picture I really
     wanted to use as my background. Or that music I wanted to listen to. All
     sync'd, all in one place. Organized, efficient, localized; Dropbox.</p>

     <p>Then a change of mind: why do I keep all this stuff that I find online
     on my local machine? I'm basically just duplicating files which already
     exist in locations online, offline for ease of access. There are websites
     which already tackle this problem. Thus, my quest began, to migrate from
     Dropbox to existing services, and remove another program from my machine.
     </p>

     <h2>Rationale</h2>
     <p>A quick aside: I'm a pretty silly guy. Not in the comedic sense, though
     I have been known to bring the funny. No, more in a principles way; I have
     silly concepts of things. Philosophical quandries and quagmires aside, 
     some of these silly ideas pertain to my computer and related  maintenance.
     See, I like having control of my environment. That's tough in life, but 
     easy on a computer. It's part of the reason I love Linux so much.

     <h2>From One to Many</h2>
     <p>There are many places that the previously all centralized content of my
     Dropbox is heading. 
     <ul>
          <li>Pictures are heading to imgur, for ease of storage and ease of 
          access to both download and share.</li>
          <li>Music is heading to Google Play, or Amazon. Either one will work,
          but not quite decided yet. </li>
          <li>Books to Amazon Kindle or Google Books depending on format.</li>
          <li>Most documents will go to Google Drive.</li>
          <li>Most applications won't go anywhere, they'll also be replaced.
          </li>
     </ul></p>

     <h2>From Apps to Applications</h2>
     <p>Most of the apps in Dropbox were Windows-specific. Putty, for example,
     I kept around in case I needed to ssh from Windows. However, with Windows
     being phased out of my day-to-day, I won't need that anymore. Others are a
     bit more difficult to replace.</p>

     <h3>Keypass</h3>
     <p>Keypass was my password store of choice, and for the longest time I
     kept it sync'd between my machines via Dropbox. However, due to a few
     concerns, I've decided to use a different approach.
