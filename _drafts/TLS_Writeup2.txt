TLS: An examination into the Security of the Internet, Part 2

In Part 1, I went over how a connection is established with TLS. In this part, I
want to examine the more involved details of TLS itself. Namely, I want to
examine certificates, cipher suites, and public key authentication.

Certificates
A certificate is a vessel for a server to provide authentication informat

Cipher Suites
A cipher is the algorithm used to encrypt the information to be transmitted.

Public-Key Authentication
Big topic, very important

Notes
Asymmetric Key Authentication:
     - Relies on two keys: Public key, Private key
     - Both keys are related, but impossible (computationally infeasable) to
       identify the private key based on the public key [1][2]
     - The public key can be distributed publicly
          - Used to encrypt message to the owner of the private paired key
          - Used to verify signatures from the private key
     - The private key is kept secret
          - Used to decrypt message from the public paired key
          - Used to as a digital signature

Basics of an Asymmetric Key handshake:
     1. Client reaches out to server, requesting a secure connection
     2. Server acknowledges request, sends back it's public key
          - This is commonly known as a certificate. Often signed by a
            third-party to ensure it is what it's supposed to be.
     3. Client uses this public key to encrypt a secret, and sends the package
     back to the server.
     4. The server then uses it's private key to decrypt the public-key
     encrypted secret, and uses that secret hence forth to encrypt all traffic.
     5. A private connection is now established.

Basics of Certificates
     1. A certificate is a vessel for a server to provide authentication
     information.
     2. Typically a certificate will contain the following information:
          - A UUID of the certificate itself
          - The subject of the certificate
          - The signature, and signature algorithm used
          - The issuer of the certificate, as well as dates when it is valid
          - The purpose of the key
          - The thumbprint, and algorithm, used to hash the key
          - The public key itself
     3. Certificate Authorities act as a third part to verify the integrity of
     public keys.
