     <h1>Farewell to Windows Tour 2015</h1>
     <p>It has come time to bid Windows farewell. Once upon a time Windows was 
     the only digital world I knew. It began when I was young, during the 
     venerable 3.1 era. I remember booting up our family computer into DOS, and
     before starting Windows I could start Doom 2 or Keen's Dream, or any
     number of other games. That was my first interaction with a command line.
     My, my, how times have changed.</p>

     <p>From Doom 2 and Keen I went on to Baldur's Gate and Battlefield. I
     dabbled here and there in NES/Sega/SNES/Genesis stuff, but PC gaming
     always held my attention. The only exception to this was my Gameboy with
     Pokemon, because that game is literal crack to a 12 year old. Baldur's
     Gate held my attention like only a classic RPG can, and I remember 
     pouring over the manual and this guidebook I had to learn as much as I
     could about the world the game created. Around this time I was also 
     getting into Dungeons and Dragons (Satan's game!), so there was a 
     definite mixture of digital and tabletop gaming. Battlefield, on the
     other hand, was introduced to me by my good friend Rob, and became a 
     classic among my group of friends. Then, of course, Smash Bros became
     a thing and that was our game of choice. That and Soul Calibur; ah 
     memories.</p>

     <p>It wasn't until relatively recently that I ever even tried gaming on
     Linux. My senior year of high school I was introduced to Linux by my 
     friend Ben. That spawned the interest, but it was always secondary to
     my true love of computers, gaming.
