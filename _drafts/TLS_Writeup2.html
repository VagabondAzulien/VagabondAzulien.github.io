     <h1>TLS: An examination into the Security of the Internet, Part 2</h1>

     <p>TLS, more often referred to as SSL, is the means by which a secure
     connection is established over a computer network. Part 1 examines how to
     establish a secure connection using TLS. This article examines further the
     techniques and technology that makes TLS secure. Specifically, a brief
     examination of certificates, cipher suites, and public-key
     authentication.</p>

     <h2>Certificates</h2> 
     <p>A certificate is a vessel for a server to provide authentication
     information. </p>

     <h2>Cipher Suites</h2> 
     <p>A cipher is the algorithm used to encrypt the information
     to be transmitted.</p>

     <h2>Public-Key Authentication</h2>
     <p>Big topic, very important!</p>

<!-- Notes (because why remove them?)
Asymmetric Key Authentication:
     - Relies on two keys: Public key, Private key
     - Both keys are related, but impossible (computationally infeasable) to
       identify the private key based on the public key [1][2]
     - The public key can be distributed publicly
          - Used to encrypt message to the owner of the private paired key
          - Used to verify signatures from the private key
     - The private key is kept secret
          - Used to decrypt message from the public paired key
          - Used to as a digital signature

Basics of an Asymmetric Key handshake:
     1. Client reaches out to server, requesting a secure connection
     2. Server acknowledges request, sends back it's public key
          - This is commonly known as a certificate. Often signed by a
            third-party to ensure it is what it's supposed to be.
     3. Client uses this public key to encrypt a secret, and sends the package
     back to the server.
     4. The server then uses it's private key to decrypt the public-key
     encrypted secret, and uses that secret hence forth to encrypt all traffic.
     5. A private connection is now established.

Basics of Certificates
     1. A certificate is a vessel for a server to provide authentication
     information.
     2. Typically a certificate will contain the following information:
          - A UUID of the certificate itself
          - The subject of the certificate
          - The signature, and signature algorithm used
          - The issuer of the certificate, as well as dates when it is valid
          - The purpose of the key
          - The thumbprint, and algorithm, used to hash the key
          - The public key itself
     3. Certificate Authorities act as a third part to verify the integrity of
     public keys.
