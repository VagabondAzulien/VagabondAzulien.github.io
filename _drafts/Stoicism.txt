     <h1>Stoicismv1</h1>
     <p>Sherman J. Clark wrote a fantastic article on the Stoicism Today blog in
     December which really spoke to me. It approached some of the questions and
     problems I've had with Stoicism in an elegant and enlightening way, which
     has led to my significantly greater understanding of Stoicism (albeit, my
     flavor of Stoicism). Notably, and what I want to highlight here, were the
     topics of <i>Selfishness</i>, <i>Metaphysics</i>, and <i>Balance</i>.</p>

     <h2>Selfishness</h2>
     <p>I have a difficult time with the idea of a universal brotherhood. Most
     of this is literally my problem: I cannot properly picture it, nor
     understand how to approach or pursue it. When Stoicism speaks of the
     importance of community or of a universal brotherhood, I generally switch
     off. Appropriately, I have a difficult time understanding how Stoic pursuit
     is anything but selfish. Everything I pursue, everything I read and try to
     apply, seems to benefit solely me. There is an argument to be made that by
     bettering myself I better others around me, but that's not fulfilling.
     Clark specifically cites this issue towards the end of his article: "I do
     not believe it possible to find within stoicism any principle that
     definitively rules out selfishness or guarantees other-regarding behavior."
     My thoughts exactly. However, like much in Stoicism and life in general,
     the answers are rarely written down, and must be discovered. Building on
     this, Clark proposes that the impetus for selflessness, or at least
     community, comes from the simple fact that learning is best done
     communally. Learning and growing in isolation does not present the most
     complete understanding of anything. And as I'll point out further down,
     learning is actually quite important!</p>

     <h2>Metaphysics</h2>

     <h2>Balance</h2>
     <p> By balance, I mean the balance of stoic thought managing emotions. It
     is common for Stoic teaching to be applied to negative emotions and
     situations. Many blogs, books, and classes focus on applying a Stoic
     mindset to stress, anxiety, depression, and the unfavorable situations that
     cause those and other similar types of emotions to arise. Clark is
     quick to propose a more important question: what happens when this approach
     is fully applied? What happens when a full pursuit of Stoicism is taken
     seriously? I appreciate Clark's use of the word "serious" when he speaks of
     this pursuit. It implies to me that half-way applying Stoic thought is an
     immature pursuit. That is to say, similar to an immature fruit tree, you
     have only part of the system available to you. This is often how I've felt.
     I know and understand the power of applying Stoic thought to difficult
     situations. I want to know, as Clark puts it, if there is any room left for
     joy after we've fully applied the Stoic philosophy.</p>

     <p><i>"it is neither appealing nor intellectually honest to take comfort
     from a philosophy that works only if you do not think about it too
     carefully"</i></p>

     <p>Clark investigates 5 possible answers to this dilemma, none of which
     fully answer our question. However, he does propose a solution, and it is a
     solution which resonates with me deeply: "true stoic joy comes through
     comprehension, understanding, and insight." When I read this conclusion, it
     was literally enlightening. Suddenly, all the frustration and concern that
     I was abusing Stoic thought just for temporary solace, was lifted from me.
     I felt relieved, joyful, and even a sense of success. <p>

- Selfish vs community

- Nature
     - nature is the universe
     - we should live in accordance with nature. what does that mean?
     - best way is to constantly seek to understand nature

- Positive and negative emotions
     - Easy to apply stoic practices to negative emotions
     - What happens when applied to positive emotions?
     - "it is neither appealing nor intellectually honest to take comfort from a
       philosophy that works only if you do not think about it too carefully"
     - I like how a full pursuit of Stoicism is often classified by Clark as
       "serious" pursuit. Several implications; importance of the word.
