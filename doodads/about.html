			<p> I'm your typical nerd/geek: I love gaming, technology, terrible techno/trance music, and having fun.</p>
			<p> I make my home base in Buffalo, NY working for a local private college. I've been in Buffalo pretty much my entire life, save for college when I went to SUNY Geneseo. I've travelled a bit, but no where close to as much as I hope to. I enjoy designing things, and am often daydreaming about many projects that I would love to someday complete and release on the world.</p>
			<p> If you've somehow stumbled onto my little patch of the Internet and read this far, I hope what you've seen or read has at least been enjoyable. Thanks for visiting, and hopefully you'll come back!</p>

			<p> This site is essentially a playground. It's an opportunity for me to gather all of my thoughts, experiments, journals, discoveries, interesting links, and many more things into one convenient place, and with my own personal approach to it. I am very much an amateur web designer, so often times the appearance of this site will be a bit strange. Don't worry, though! I promise not to leave this place in a permanent state of disarray, only an occasionally, temporary one.</p>
			<p> What I want from this site is more than a web presence. I'm hoping that this site will inspire and motivate me to really explore my surroundings. I yearn to travel the world, and my journies online are still in Chapter 1. This is why I chose 'vagabond.' A vagabond is, to me, a wanderer of whim and adventure; one who lives for the next experience, wherever it may take them. Hopefully, I can adventure both on- and off-line, share my voyages, and learn something in the process too.</p>
