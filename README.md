# The Internet Vagabond dot com

My name is Bill Niblock. I'm a computer scientist by education, a technologist
by trade, a gamer by hobby, and a philosopher by accident. I currently live in
Buffalo, New York.

This site is a small slice of internet real-estate that I use for occasional
writing. Nothing I say is visionary or profound. I will tend to focus on
technology, gaming, and philosophy. All opinions my own.

### To-Do

* Cleaned up styles a bit, notably removing the use of header tags outside of
    post content.

    CC0.
