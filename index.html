     <h1>Welcome</h1>
     <p>Welcome to The Internet Vagabond, a small slice of Internet
     real-estate for Bill Niblock. Nothing I say is visionary or
     profound, and sometimes it makes sense. You can find a list of
     any posts and projects I've made available in the menu on the right.
     Just click the menu button in the upper-right to view it.</p>
     
     <h3>About the Site</h3>
     <p>The Internet Vagabond is a simple website I use for the rare
     blog posts I make, information about me and the projects I work
     on, and a digital plot of e-land. It is programmed as much in
     HTML and CSS as possible, and designed with a small footprint.
     The site is hosted on GitHub, and utilizes Jekyll for further
     organization and optimization. If you're interested in more 
     technical details, check out the GitHub Project page for this
     repository. You can easily get to it via the menu on the right.</p>

     <h3>About the Vagabond</h3>
     <p>My name is Bill Niblock, and I consider myself a citizen of the
     Internet. I'm a computer scientist by education, a technologist by
     trade, a gamer by hobby, a philosopher by choice, and the list goes
     on.</p>

     <p>I earned my degree in Computer Science from SUNY Geneseo in the
     state of New York. There I developed a great appreciation for clean and 
     efficient code and systems. I learned how to develop on bare-bones
     systems, surviving purely on a Terminal in Linux for a few years of my
     studies. I discovered the magic of Lisp, tail-recursion, and intricate
     code. It was there I also wet my appetite for Git, and it's incredible
     power. From school I moved on to work for a small local college as a
     Sys-Admin/Tech Support/Hardware Specialist/Software Developer/Network Guy.
     After several years of learning all about everything there, I snagged
     a sweet job working for Yahoo in the Operations Center, where I help
     monitor and support all the circuits and servers that keep Yahoo up
     and running. Thus far, I've expanded my Linux knowledge incredibly, and
     have developed a stronger understanding of coding with a group, utilizing
     Git and GitHub for stronger development, and a fascination with Ruby. I
     look forward to all that Yahoo has to offer, in the bottomless source of
     knowledge and experience that the awesome co-workers I have there have to
     offer.</p>

     <p>Ever since the early 90s I've loved gaming. Whether table-top,
     role-playing, or computer gaming, I adore it. I began my journey as a
     young lad who's mother installed Commander Keen and Doom 2 on our family
     computer. From there, I worked my way through Starcraft, Baldur's Gate,
     Neverwinter Nights, and so many more before getting my first laptop in
     high school. Then Steam happened, and now I play more games than I can
     remember. With the advent of Steam for Linux, I've been able to suppliment
     my love and fascination of Linux with my passion for gaming. I've
     settled on a few specific games of note: Guild Wars 2 is my MMO of choice,
     and both it and it's predecessor have offered me many hours of exploration
     and wonder. Dota 2 has stolen a lot of my free time, as have Counter
     Strike and Team Fortress 2. Then there's the myriad of independent games
     which round-out my gaming library, and help to eat all my free time.</p>
     
     <p>Technology and gaming join philosophy to create my tri-force. I consider
     an understanding of our environments, our actions and the consequences of
     actions to be key to a fruitful life. My first experience with philosophy
     came about through church, and more specifically through a youth group which
     met Sundays during mass. There we discussed topics, albeit with a religious
     undertone, but with an emphasis on understanding and openness. It was an
     expereience which helped lead me down a path of further exploration. 
     During high school we touched on the "big names" or philosophy, but it
     was in college where I discovered the philosophy which best fits my 
     understanding of the universe: Stoicism. To be brief, the ancient Stoics
     put emphasis on rationality and logic, seeking an understanding of their
     actions, consequences and environments through observation. For simplicity,
     think of the Vulcans from Star Trek. Stoicism is much more than just Spock,
     but for now, I'll leave it at that.</p>

     <p>I have many hobbies, and am fascinated by the universe we find ourselves
     in. I hope to explore many of these through this site, and look forward
     to understanding and exploring topics both new and old.</p>
