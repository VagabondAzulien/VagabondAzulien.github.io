     <h1>Welcome</h1>
     <p>Welcome to The Internet Vagabond, a small slice of Internet
     real-estate for Bill Niblock. Nothing I say is visionary or
     profound, and sometimes it makes sense.</p>
     
     <h3>About the Site</h3>
     <p>The Internet Vagabond is a small slice of Internet real-estate
     for Bill Niblock. I don't have much of a use for this site, 
     currently, so it's more of a empty plot than a store-front.</p>
     <p>The site's side-menu offers links to a few of my active GitHub
     repositories, as well as links to my social network profiles.
     Feel free to examine and use any of the code in my repos, so long
     as that use adheres to the WTFPL.</p>
     <p>I try to keep this site as minimal and useful as possible. I've
     enjoyed the most recent re-structure, as it has allowed me to
     use only HTML5 and CSS3. As more web-techologies arise, I look
     forward to exploring their uses and employing them on this site.</p>
     
     <h3>About the Vagabond</h3>
     <p>I like to consider myself a citizen of the Internet. I enjoy
     gaming, philosophy, and technology in general.</p>
     <p>I enjoy all sorts of gaming, be it table-top or computer. 
     Thanks to the advent of Steam on Linux, I've been able to 
     maintain my Linux desktop while enjoying some very great games.
     Currently, my largest time-sinks are Dota 2, Guild Wars 2, and
     an assortment of independent titles.</p>
