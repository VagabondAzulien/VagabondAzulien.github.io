     <h1>Welcome</h1>
     <p>Welcome to The Internet Vagabond, a small slice of Internet
     real-estate for Bill Niblock. Nothing I say is visionary or
     profound, and sometimes it makes sense. You can find a list of
     any posts and projects I've made available in the menu on the right.
     Just click the menu button in the upper-right to view it.</p>
     
     <h2>About the Site</h2>
     <p>The Internet Vagabond is a simple website I use for the rare
     blog posts I make, information about me and the projects I work
     on, and a digital plot of e-land. It is programmed as much in
     HTML and CSS as possible, and designed with a small footprint.
     The site is hosted on GitHub, and utilizes Jekyll for further
     organization and optimization. If you're interested in more 
     technical details, check out the GitHub Project page for this
     repository [WIP]. You can easily get to it via the menu on the right.</p>

     <h2>About the Vagabond</h2>
     <p>I'm a computer scientist by education, a technologist by
     trade, a gamer by hobby, a philosopher by choice, and the list goes
     on. I'm quite fond of Linux, in particular the command line, and the myriad
     of fascinating and intricate programs which call them home. I'm an avid
     gamer, though I tend to shy away from the AAA releases. I am actively
     pursuing a better understanding of Stoicism, and, more generally, our
     universe. Learning is my ultimate passion, and I act accordingly to live my
     passions every day.</p>
