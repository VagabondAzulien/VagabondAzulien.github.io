# Preamble to the Pathfinder

For many years now, I've been playing in several Pathfinder games. I very much
enjoy the system, if only because I love options in roleplaying games. During
the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, in addition to my weekly game, a second
group started a weekly game. This one, unlike the campaign I've been playing in
for the last 6 years (we're level 9), sees the characters level up after
each adventure, and is meant more as a quick and fun string of one-shots. After
a few weeks of Lizzie starting and running the "campaign," I volunteered to run.
This post covers my one-shot `The crater of Igrevor`.

## Background

Before hopping in, a little background. The party at this point had gone on
several adventures and made a name for themselves in a relatively small town.
They decided to settle down, and because the details of this town weren't known
at the time, all the players collaborated to establish the Town of Ulriksted. I
took some liberties with the what we established, and decided that a powerful
wizard has also moved to the town, seeing it as an opportunity for trade, but
also a good place for a fancy tower. Wizards love their towers. Thus, Igrevor
was born.

```
Igrevor Thel'lessell

Lawful Neutral Elf

Cleric of Abadar: 3 // Wizard (Conjurer: Teleportation): 3 // Mystic Theurge: 10
```

As a follower of Abadar, Igrevor is very interested in trade and travel, both on
the material and other planes. His arcane studies also focus on extraplanar
travel and research. And because I've always been interested in the `Mystic
Theurge` class, I decided this was a perfect opportunity to make use of it. As a
trader, I focused his build on several magical crafting feats: wonderous items,
magical arms and armor, and constructs.

Igrevor's tower sits to the north of town, along the river which flows through
Ulriksted. He offers his arcane services to the town, as well as crafting and
selling his magical wares to adventurers when they travel through. Unfortunately
for him, a powerful [Night
Hag](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/monstrous-humanoids/hag/hag-night)
has taken an interest in him, and has been haunting his dreams for a while now.
Being a powerful wizard, he's been able to defend himself and his tower
accordingly, but the Hag has decided to get some assistance. You see, Igrevor
has established a powerful teleportation and planar travel system within his
tower, albeit a well protected one. The Hag, studying this herself, conspired to
exploit this with the help of a several extraplanar allies: Several
[Xill](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/xill)
raiding parties, to which she provided
[Nightmare](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/nightmare/)
mounts; and two [Umbral
Dragon](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/dragons/dragon/-primal-umbral/umbral-dragon-juvenile)
brothers.

**Encounter: Xill Raiding Party**

The first encounter is relatively easy for the party, considering at this point
they're level 9. There are 4 Xill, each riding a Nightmare. Each has a special
elemental key, tied to each of the four elemental planes: earth, air, water, and
fire. The last Xill looted also has a note, written in Infernal: "These keys
will keep the portals open, and the tower inaccessible. Once you have your new
hosts, return to the Ethereal plane. DO NOT LOSE THEM!" Whoops.

>Igrevor: **In dire need of assistance. Tower under attack. Must close portals.
>Please hurry! WILL REWARD! Use teleportation circle in foyer; top of tower**_

At this point, I also introduce a small mechanic related to the portals: Each
elemental portal gives the PCs a boon:

- Plane of Earth: DR 1/- for each elemental planar portal open
- Plane of Fire: Aura, 5ft: 1 fire damage for each elemental planar portal open
- Plane of Water: Fast Healing 1 for each elemental planar portal open
- Plane of Air: Bonus 1ft. Movement speed for each elemental planar portal open

Each of these boons is removed as soon an the associated portal is closed.

**Puzzle: The Elemental Portals**

To reach the tower, the party much figure out a way to close the portals.
Initially, each portal claims a quarter of the ground around the portal. Closing
a portal causes the adjacent portals to claim the ground, increasing their power
and decreasing the power of the opposite portal. If coordinated, it should be
possible for the party to close all portals simultaneously.

With the four elemental portals closed, the tower is now accessible. The party
must somehow ascend 20 feet into the air to get to the lowest ruins, and then a
Climb (DC 10) check to get to the rest of the tower, 10 feet further up. This,
like a few other obstacles, was a way to force the party to use resources. The
sorcerer of the group knows fly, and so this was a way to get him to use a
spell. The way I tend to run many of my games is to try and force my players to
think about their resources, and manage them accordingly. To be fair, I try to
give alternatives. For example, the party could use rope to climb up. I think in
this case, they used either `Mage Hand` or a familiar to loop rope around some
rubble, then the fighter climbed up and attached a better rope, and they were
able to ascend without expending many resources at all.

>_Once inside, there is a corkscrew stairwell along the walls of the tower,
>ascending roughly another 20 feet. At the top, light and shadows play on the
>wall near where the stairs enter a new floor._

If the party is perceptive or stealthy enough, they can notice several figures
waiting on the next floor, as well as get the drop on them!

**Encounter: Xill and Night Hag**

>_A tall, gaunt figure with long limbs stands with two more Xill. Her skin
>stretches tightly across her bones, and a grin stretches across her nightmarish
>visage. Claws and fangs betray her intent._

Here, again, I tried to force a change of tactics. The room the party fights in
is only 20 by 20. The usual `Fireball` approach would be dangerous. The party
was clever and perceptive, though, and the sorcerer was able to approach the
room invisibly, and place a `Fireball` in a way so as to kill the Xill. The Hag
is immune to fire, conveniently, and so the party had to deal with her some
other way. Also, she can cast `Invisibility` at will, which helper her get the
drop on the party. The sorcerer `Fireball`'s the room, ducking down the
stairwell to avoid the blast. While no one can see her, she goes invisible. The
party doesn't see any threats, enters the room, and she pounces. Hag's are great
opponents. They have a great kit for DMs to play with; great defenses, including
damage reduction, a solid set of immunities, and spell resistance 24! The lore
of hags, as extraplanar scavengers and traders, is also fascinating. I'd like to
use one in a future campaign, especially an evil campaign, and have this be a
companion NPC or something.

With this encounter completed, the party stands in the aforementioned foyer, and
on the ground they see an arcane circle: the teleportation circle.

>_The corpse of the night hag fades into shadow, as it disappears from the
>material plane. With the room now secured, you see arcane symbols inscribed in
>the center of the room. This must be the teleportation circle Igrevor mentioned
>in his sending. As you step into the circle, you find yourself transported to a
>large, cylindrical room. An inner wall breaks at four equidistant places,
>revealing an outer wall, and a shimmering pool of light in a small alcove._

>_Exploring the space, the inner room has the teleportation circle, and many
>arcane symbols drawn into the stone and the walls._ A Knowledge(Arcana) or
>Spellcraft, DC 15, reveals the symbols to be protections related to
>teleportation, plane shifting, and the like. _Checking the outer ring, you find
>the four aforementioned pools, as well as a wall of force blocking a hallway._

>_Oh a whim, you glance up, and see two spheres circling the room. One is pure
>white, and the other black. They maintain a perfect distance from each other._ A
>Knowledge(Planes), DC 15, identifies the spheres as being made of pure positive
>and negative energy, respectively. _You now notice, as the spheres pass by the
>alcoves, the pools briefly shift towards the color of the sphere, and the wall
>of force slightly..._

Or, at least, that was the original intention. As so often happens, I wasn't
quite satisfied with this part of the original adventure, and modified this it
slightly. Originally, the party was going to fight a "Planar Scion." Initially,
the party would find two humanoid energy beings, one made of positive energy and
one made of negative energy. The beings would be indestructible, and the party
would have to merge them to create a single being, which was now vulnerable.
But, I couldn't figure out a good way to convey this information, while making
the combat engaging, in the time I had, so I scrapped it for a puzzle instead.

**Puzzle: Spheres and Pools**

>_As you navigate the room, you find the hallway leading from this room, and an
>opaque barrier blocking the way forward._

>_Oh a whim, you glance up, and see four spheres circling the room. Two are pure
>white, and the others black. They maintain a perfect distance from each other._ A
>Knowledge(Planes), DC 15, identifies the spheres as being made of pure positive
>and negative energy, respectively. _You now notice, as the spheres pass by the
>alcoves, the pools briefly shift towards the color of the sphere, and the
>barrier slightly dissipates_

The only way through this barrier is to stop the rotating spheres. As alluded to
in the descriptive text, the pools and the spheres are related. As the spheres
pass over the pools, they shift the pools from clear towards the color of the
sphere, and I added that the spheres appear to slow down very slightly. The
party had to use positive and negative energy sources to shift the pools to the
appropriate attunement, which stopped the spheres, and opened the barrier.

**Final Encounter: Umbral Dragon**

>_As the spheres stop, above the pools, they descend into the pools, and
> dissolve the barrier blocking the way out of the room. Moving through the
> hallway, you come to a large meeting hall. An oak table, which could almost
> seat the entire town of Ulriksted, sits in the middle of the hall, with chairs

> dragons standing opposite him. He turns to you, and speaks, "The Lords of
> Ulriksted! And just in time! I am sorry, friends, I cannot assist you further;
> one of these beasts took most of my arsenal to defeat. I beg your assistance!"
> As he finishes, you see a sphere arise around him, and him kneel to catch his
> breath._

The boss battle! The juvenile Umbral Dragon! I toned down the beast a bit, but I
definitely shouldn't have. It was a good fight, and the barbarian did not hold
back. As the party defeated them, Igrevor thanked them, and their reward was any
single magical item that he can make. In addition, because I'm prone to giving
my PCs overpowered items, I allowed each of them to have an item made from the
scales of the dragon, which gives them the immunities of the dragon. This turned
out to be a _very_ powerful option: immune to cold, death effects, negative
energy, paralysis, sleep.

## Aftermath

I had a lot of fun with this one. The party made their way with through with
consistent progress, and the boss battle was challenging but not overwhelming. I
think, if run again, I wouldn't tone down the boss. I ended up running a
follow-up adventure, which is currently untitled, but which became a two parter,
and the driving motivation for my upcoming third adventure. I look forward to
sharing those as well! Feel free to make use of this adventure in your own
games!

## MapTools

But wait, there's more! This adventure was my first foray into MapTools, a free
and open-source virtual table top system. It allows you to create detailed
maps, add tokens, set sight lines, and much more. You can host a server locally
that your players can connect to, and they can move things around themselves.
Or, if you're a bit lazier like me, you can share your screen on your voice call
of choice, and just move the tokens for players instead. I had a lot of fun
crafting Igrevor's Tower in MapTools, and then sharing that with my players
during the session. It really made the game more enjoyable, and more immersive
than just a standard voice-and-video call.

The community for the MapTool suite has built a lot of tokens, tile sets, and
additional assets to really explore and build _exactly_ what you want. I
certainly made good use of CSP's Dungeon Geomorphs (available for free directly
within MapTools, and made by [Kristian
Richards](https://www.crookedstaff.co.uk/)), [Devin
Night's](https://immortalnights.com/tokensite/) tokens (some of which are
available for free, but are well worth the price) and Torstan's Markers and
Objects (also available directly within MapTools). I'm not sure if the campaign
will load without those enabled, but for anyone interested, you can find a link
to the campaign maps for this adventure [here (click to download)](
