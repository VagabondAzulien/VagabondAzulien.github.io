<h1>Revelations: Developing Stoic Understanding</h1>
<p>Sherman J. Clark wrote a fantastic article on the Stoicism Today blog in
December which really spoke to me. It approached some of the questions and
problems I've had with Stoicism in an elegant and enlightening way, which
has led to my significantly greater understanding of Stoicism. Notably, and
what I want to highlight here, were the topics of <i>Selfishness</i>,
<i>Metaphysics</i>, and <i>Balance</i>.</p>

<h3>Selfishness</h3>
<p>I have a difficult time with the idea of a universal brotherhood. I
cannot properly picture it, nor understand how to approach or pursue it.
When Stoicism speaks of the importance of community or of a universal
brotherhood, I generally switch off. Appropriately, I have a difficult time
understanding how Stoic pursuit is anything but selfish. Everything I
pursue, everything I read and try to apply, seems to benefit solely me.
There is an argument to be made that by bettering myself I better others
around me, but that does not provide a fulfilling conclusion. It doesn't
actually promote social action, rather it proposes a benefit if I take
action. I'm looking for a reason to take that action, which seems to be
lacking. Clark specifically cites this issue towards the end of his
article: "I do not believe it possible to find within stoicism any
principle that definitively rules out selfishness or guarantees
other-regarding behavior." My thoughts exactly. Clark thus proposes that
the impetus for selflessness, or at least community, comes from the simple
fact that learning is best done communally. This I can certainly agree
with, if only considering the obvious fact that I do not know every answer
to every question, and thus I must seek them from external sources.
Learning with others promotes diverse opinions and solutions, often outside
the scope of my approach.</p>

<p><i>"Not only do we need the insights of others to help us understand our
world better, but our own experience and understanding is best achieved not
in isolation but in shared conversationâ€”dialectic."</i></p>

<p>This point is building block 1; the first of three pieces to a puzzle:
<b>learning promotes selflessness</b>.</p>

<h3>Metaphysics</h3>
<p>To paraphrase Carl Sagan, we are the universe's way of understanding
itself. To Stoics, the universe is often synonymous with Nature. Living in
accordance with Nature is basically Stoic virtue. That's a very big
basically, and a very simplified view of Stoic virtue. However (a) I'm not
very good at explaining this; and (b) it's a <b>very</b> involved topic. I
want to touch on it briefly, since it is both covered by Clark and also
relevant to the discussion. Clark makes a very straight-forward argument
that Physics, or science to a more general degree, is appropriate as a
Stoic virtue. Again he touches on the importance of learning, and expands
it to how science is the means by which we can learn and understand the
beauty and order of our universe. By learning and understanding more about
the universe (Nature), we can better live in accordance with Nature. I'm
simplifying again significantly, but I think it boils down to knowledge.
Temperance and courage, two significant Stoic virtues, are defined by Clark
as a symptom of awareness. Temperance is the awareness that what others
crave is not worth craving after; courage is the awareness that what others
fear is not worth fearing. If virtues are best defined as properly attuned
awareness, then what better awareness to develop than the awareness of how
the universe works? As a computer scientist, and a person who finds great joy
in understanding systems and why they work, this makes perfect sense to me.
Building block 2: <b>awareness and understanding is the foundation of
virtue</b>.

<h3>Balance</h3>
<p> By balance, I mean the balance of stoic thought managing emotions. It
is common for Stoic teaching to be applied to negative emotions and
situations. Many blogs, books, and classes focus on applying a Stoic
mindset to stress, anxiety, depression, and the unfavorable situations that
cause those and other similar types of emotions to arise. Clark is
quick to propose a more important question: what happens when this approach
is fully applied? What happens when a full pursuit of Stoicism is taken
seriously? I appreciate Clark's use of the word "serious" when he speaks of
this pursuit. It implies to me that half-way applying Stoic thought is an
immature pursuit. That is to say, similar to an immature fruit tree, you
have only part of the system available to you. This is often how I've felt.
I know and understand the power of applying Stoic thought to difficult
situations. I want to know, as Clark puts it, if there is any room left for
joy after we've fully applied the Stoic philosophy.</p>

<p><i>"It is neither appealing nor intellectually honest to take comfort
from a philosophy that works only if you do not think about it too
carefully."</i></p>

<p>Clark investigates 5 possible answers to this dilemma, none of which
fully answer our question. However, he does propose a solution, and it is a
solution which resonates with me deeply: <b>"true stoic joy comes through
comprehension, understanding, and insight</b>." And that's the final
building block.</p>

<h2>Completing the Puzzle</h2>
<p>Putting it all together, what I took from Clark, and what has helped me
to better understand Stoicism as it applies to me:</p>

<p><b>True stoic joy comes from learning about our universe,
together.</b></p>

<p>This has always been what has brought me the most happiness, but to hear
it from someone else now makes it much more potent. Almost ironically so,
considering one of the first topics I wrote about above was my general
disregard of community in Stoicism. In retrospect, it makes perfect sense
why I find computers so fascinating, or puzzles, or even video games: they
force me to learn about a system. And what more complex and unexplored
system exists than the literal infinity of the universe? When we pursue the
Stoic ideal too completely, there is a perceived risk that we will grow
completely apathetic, forced to acknowledge that while negative emotions
are not worth concern, so too are positive emotions, including joy! With
the revelation that true joy comes from understanding, the flawed
perception is then clarified to show flawed pursuit: we grow apathetic not
because we incorrectly realise nothing in the world is worthwhile, but
because we fail to understand the system. We grow apathetic by not
understanding the universe, or at the very least by ignoring the call to
curiosity. Everything boils down to understanding: we develop temperance
by understanding what is worth pursuit; we develop courage by understanding
fear; we develop wisdom by understanding how to learn; we develop justice
by understanding righteousness and wellness.</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>My challenge now is to embrace this lifestyle completely. In the confines
and privacy of my own mind, it's very easy to follow. The only emotions and
opinions I need to concern myself with are my own, and I work hard to
properly concern myself with them. When it comes to others, I will
face emotions and opinions which I may disagree with, which may be
downright harmful, or which will hinder my pursuits. I will face failure
and frustration, especially so when opinions are concerned. This is where I
must double my efforts, and lead by example: show that the point is not to
win, or be the best, but to learn and understand. But what if this hinders
another, or makes them uncomfortable, or causes them harm? When I'm in
social interactions, I go out of my way to avoid uncomfortable or harmful
scenarios. I try not to call out others on their faults or failures,
because I don't believe them to be capable of handling it. That may be
worse than an accusation: to assume weakness or inability!</p>

<p>I must learn to act in accordance with Nature. I must seek to understand
all that I experience. I will seek the experience of others to verify or
improve my understanding as often as possible. Likewise, I will provide
others with my experience, so that they may learn and improve their
understanding. I will never do so in an attempt to prove myself superior,
because I know that pursuit is fruitless; pride does not bestow
understanding. And if others try to prove themselves superior to me, then I
will most likely let them, because pride does not bestow understanding.
Plus, if they are superior to me, then I have a source of knowledge!</p>

<p>In summary, I'm left with a question, and a revelation. The revelation
is that the greatest joy in life is understanding the universe. The
question is, how do I share this joy with others without being offensive or
insensitive? So long as my intentions are pure, I'm doing what I can to
avoid those problems, and the remainder rests on the audience.</p>

- Selfish vs community

- Nature
- nature is the universe
- we should live in accordance with nature. what does that mean?
- best way is to constantly seek to understand nature

- Positive and negative emotions
- Easy to apply stoic practices to negative emotions
- What happens when applied to positive emotions?
- "it is neither appealing nor intellectually honest to take comfort from a
philosophy that works only if you do not think about it too carefully"
- I like how a full pursuit of Stoicism is often classified by Clark as
"serious" pursuit. Several implications; importance of the word.
