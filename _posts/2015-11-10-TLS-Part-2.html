     <h1>TLS: An examination into the Security of the Internet, Part 2</h1>

     <p>TLS, more often referred to as SSL, is the means by which a secure
     connection is established over a computer network. Part 1 examines how to
     establish a secure connection using TLS. This article examines further the
     techniques and technology that makes TLS secure. Specifically, a brief
     examination of certificates, cipher suites, and public-key
     authentication.</p>

     <h2>Certificates</h2>
     <p>A certificate is a vessel for a domain to provide authentication
     information. More specifically, and perhaps most importantly, a certificate
     is the package which transfers a key. TLS relies entirely upon Public-Key
     Authentication to setup a secure connection. The challenge with Public-Key
     Authentication is often sharing keys in a verifiable and secure manner.
     This is to say that, despite public keys being public, you still need to
     verify the owner of the key. This is where certificates, and Certificate
     Authorities come in. Each certificate is tailored to a specific domain. It
     includes not only the public key for a user to connect to the server with,
     but also meta-data about the certificate: a UUID, and information about the
     Certificate Authority; a signature authorizing the certificate, as well as
     the encryption used for the signature; a thumbprint of the key, and details
     of the algorithm used to hash the key; and a purpose for the certificate.
     Certificates may contain additional details, but the aforementioned list is
     required.</p>

     <p>A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted third-party repository of
     signed keys. The purpose of a CA is very specific: verification. A CA will
     generate and issue a key-pair to a domain. The domain can then share the
     public key using a certificate. How specifically a CA verifies the domains
     and keys is out of scope of this discussion, but Wikipedia provides many
     details on the techniques used.</p>

     <h2>Cipher Suites</h2>
     <p>A cipher is the algorithm used to encrypt information. Ciphers are
     incredibly complex mathematical formulae, and are well beyond my
     understanding. However, it is important to note that the strength of a key
     is only as strong as the cipher suite used to generate it. Likewise, the
     strength of a certificate is only as strong as the cipher used to sign
     it. Keep this in mind when you generate and work with keys.</p>

     <h2>Public-Key Authentication</h2>
     <p>The most important part of TLS is public-key authentication. I would
     argue that public-key authentication is one of the most important facets of
     the technical world. Because of this, I want to recap in more general terms
     how public-key authentication works:</p>

     <ol>
          <li>Two parties want to establish a secure connection.</li>
          <li>Each party generates two keys: one to share publicly, one to keep
          secret.</li>
          <li>Each party then shares their public keys.</li>
     </ol>

     <p>Now, whenever one of the two parties wants to securely communicate with
     the other, they "sign" (encrypt) the communication with their private key.
     The second party can then use the public key of the first party to verify
     the identify of the sender, and decrypt the message.

     <h2>Conclusion</h2>
     <p>Security is a very deep and involved topic, but one I feel every
     Sys-Admin should know a bit about. While these posts are only meant to serve
     as a high-level overview of TLS, there are many more-detailed sources
     available. I would suggest a visit to your local Wikipedia as a good first
     step. Thanks for reading.</p>

<!-- Notes (because why remove them?)
Asymmetric Key Authentication:
     - Relies on two keys: Public key, Private key
     - Both keys are related, but impossible (computationally infeasible) to
       identify the private key based on the public key [1][2]
     - The public key can be distributed publicly
          - Used to encrypt message to the owner of the private paired key
          - Used to verify signatures from the private key
     - The private key is kept secret
          - Used to decrypt message from the public paired key
          - Used to as a digital signature

Basics of an Asymmetric Key handshake:
     1. Client reaches out to server, requesting a secure connection
     2. Server acknowledges request, sends back it's public key
          - This is commonly known as a certificate. Often signed by a
            third-party to ensure it is what it's supposed to be.
     3. Client uses this public key to encrypt a secret, and sends the package
     back to the server.
     4. The server then uses it's private key to decrypt the public-key
     encrypted secret, and uses that secret hence forth to encrypt all traffic.
     5. A private connection is now established.

Basics of Certificates
     1. A certificate is a vessel for a server to provide authentication
     information.
     2. Typically a certificate will contain the following information:
          - A UUID of the certificate itself
          - The subject of the certificate
          - The signature, and signature algorithm used
          - The issuer of the certificate, as well as dates when it is valid
          - The purpose of the key
          - The thumbprint, and algorithm, used to hash the key
          - The public key itself
     3. Certificate Authorities act as a third part to verify the integrity of
     public keys.
