     <h1>Perception And Thought</h1>

     <p>I consider myself a very philosophical person. That doesn't mean I'm any
     good at philosophy, I just tend to think a lot about ethics, morality, and
     happiness. Recently I've been thinking more about my worldview, what I
     value as important, and how I achieve happiness in my daily life. I wanted
     to jot down what I feel is a brief examination of my basic tenants; the
     basic Philosophy of Bill.</p>

     <p>I derive a lot of my philosophy from my Christian up-bringing and
     Stoicism. I'm not a very religious person, though. I never really was. My
     belief of what God is falls strongly under the agnostic category: I'm not
     sure what God is, or if I believe in a God, but I do believe in a higher
     power of some sort. I feel it's logical to always assume there is something
     more powerful than yourself, but I also feel it's impossible to prove this.
     I like to define faith as simply irrational belief. I have faith in many
     things, both permanent and temporary. I like faith, actually, quite a bit.
     I admire those who have strong faith, so long as they maintain reason and
     are not fanatical. I also try to maintain a very open approach to religion.
     I believe everyone has the right to worship however they choose, so long as
     it does not involve anything overly immoral, such as killing. I have a hard
     time tolerating people who are overly zealous about their faith, or about
     denouncing someone else's faith. Nothing is more disgusting than attacking
     someone for their beliefs. They are called beliefs for a reason; they are
     not fact, they are opinion. It's ineffective to attack opinions, because
     they are ephemeral to begin with. Like trying to hit a ghost with a
     lamp-post: it just won't do what you think it will.</p>

     <p>I love debate and discussion, but there is a clear difference between
     debate for truth and argument for winning. I try to keep in the first camp,
     but I'm not super-human and I have an ego so I often visit the later.
     However, I always learn when I make mistakes, and I cherish when I fail,
     because it only serves to better myself. I think that's the most
     fundamental under-lying theme of my philosophy: always better myself;
     always learn something. That ego thing, though, that's a tough monster to
     handle. I've found myself adopting views similar to Zen Buddism (I think)
     often when trying to quell my ego:</p>

     <p><ul>
          <li> All will return to nothingness.</li>
          <li> Ergo, what I do will be inconsequential.</li>
          <li> Ergo, I am inconsequential.</li>
     </ul></p>

     <p>I think most people hear this and grow disheartened or depressed, but I
     view it as very uplifting. There's a certain freedom in knowning that, no
     matter how much I fail, in the end it won't matter much. It's sobering to
     remember that no matter how much I've achieved or won, in the end it won't
     matter much. It's important to remember that I am nothing but an improbable
     spec of matter floating on a rock in an unimaginably vast and empty space.
     Too many people get caught up on that "in the end" part, though, and they
     begin to question why they should act at all. Well, there's a bit of time
     between now and "the end" and you need to fill the void with something. For
     me, that's learning, and understanding, and appreciating.</p>

     <p>In my studies, I've discovered and adopted Stoicism as a philosophy. I
     won't explain too much what Stoicism is about, since there are many sources
     online which do that. I apply Stoicism mostly in the mental aspects of the
     philosophy, and less in the faith/religious aspects. From Stoicism, I have
     reinforced my beliefs in the importance of understanding our environment. I
     remind myself every day of things I cannot control, and that I can only
     control my perception of things. I try to act according to logic and
     wisdom, and not according to feelings, which can hamper reason. For
     example, I try not to let anger control my actions if I get trolled by my
     friend Nick. I understand that anger, love, stress, and all other feelings
     are very much out of my control, but allowing them to control me is well
     within my control. In other words, I very much get angry, or grow lustful,
     or prideful, but I try not to let those feelings dictate my actions. I
     believe it was Seneca the Younger who said, "Men are not angered by things,
     but by their perceptions of them." One of many mantra I keep in
     reserve.</p>

     <p>The most important thing in my life, though, is not control but
     happiness. I can seek to control my perceptions and emotions all I want,
     but if it does not lead to happiness, it is a fruitless endeavor. I find
     happiness most when I learn; when I understand a system. I'm an engineer at
     heart, so I view the world as a system of systems (of systems, of
     systems...) each of which is bare to understanding. I free myself from ego
     and oppression so that I can learn without fear of failure or the
     disapproval of my peers. I like to always remind myself that the only
     person who truly cares about me, is me. That's not to say others don't care
     about me, but they care about themselves first, and me afterwards.  That's
     how things are; it's not wrong or depressing or hurtful it's just the way
     the system works. I care for many people, but I'm always number one on the
     list.</p>

     <p>While all this is well and good, philosophy is an ever changing system;
     a CICD environment. I am constantly integrating new ideas and concepts into
     my understanding of the world, and sometimes purging old or unnecessary
     ones. I have my fair-share of quandries, perhaps more so than others;
     perhaps it's an unfair-share. That's what makes it worth it, though, to me.
     I seek to learn, and in doing so, find happiness and confusion. It's a
     recursive system: the confusion leads to learning, which leads to happiness
     and confusion. And I love recursion.</p>
